## Hi, I’m Parisa Mostafavi 👋  

I work at the intersection of **business strategy, analytics, and machine learning**, focusing on turning complex business problems into scalable, data-driven solutions with measurable impact.

With 7+ years of experience in data analytics and insight leadership, my work goes beyond modeling and dashboards. I focus on **problem framing, decision design, and execution**, ensuring analytical outputs directly inform strategy, pricing, targeting, and operational priorities.

### How I approach problems
- Start from **business objectives and constraints**, not from models  
- Translate ambiguous questions into **clear analytical and decision frameworks**  
- Combine **domain knowledge, data, and experimentation** to drive strategy  
- Build solutions that are **actionable, interpretable, and scalable**

### Areas of focus
- Business and growth strategy powered by data  
- Customer & product segmentation  
- Personalization and targeting
